You want a good balance of protein and carbohydrates. Coconut water is great for replenishing electrolytes lost during your workout. This recipe contains about 40 grams of protein, and that’s without using protein powder! Whey protein is preferred because it is one of the fastest digesting proteins, allowing it to get to the weakened and stressed muscle fibers as quickly as possible.
