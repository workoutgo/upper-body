GNC Beyond Raw, LIT, Clinically Dosed PreWorkout, Orange From ru.iherb.com
Citrulline is one of the best pre workout ingredients for getting crazy pumps, and 3 grams per serving is enough to see some benefits. Also, it improves the composition of your body by allowing you to train harder and longer. To compare, 1 scoop of c4 is 150mg. I believe 1 scoop of lit is 250mg of caffeine so you&#39;re taking 500mg of caffeine at once.
