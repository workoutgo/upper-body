In the ‘push’ workout you will train the upper body pushing muscles which are the chest, shoulders, and triceps. This article will feature everything you need to know about the program, how it compares to other programs, and how you can customize it. I&#39;ve been lifting weights for around 2 years and i have been thinking about this for sometime. This allows for high workout frequency and a full body split workout while still allowing each muscle group adequate recovery time.
