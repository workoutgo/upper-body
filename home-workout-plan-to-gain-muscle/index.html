“to build muscle, target at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight (2.2 grams per kg).” This means that you will perform five circuits on five different days of the week, each targeting different muscle groups. If you do squats with weights, don’t risk the form and depth of your squats just to squat with more weight. You can run in place, do air punches and kicks, or some jumping jacks.
