4 Push Ups To A Powerful Looking Physique From pinterest.com
Each workout starts out with a compound lift using a 15 rep goal over 5 sets. Vary the order in which the movements are performed and prioritize the big lifts. In contrast, you could organize your workout according to pushing and pulling movements, so your chest, shoulders, thighs, and tri’s get hit on the push day, and your back, hamstrings, biceps, and rear delts get worked on the pull days. Perform the push days on mondays and thursdays and the pull days on tuesdays and fridays, resting the remainder of the days.
