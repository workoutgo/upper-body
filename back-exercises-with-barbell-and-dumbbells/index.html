Back and shoulder workout From pinterest.com
Brace your core, then pull the dumbbell toward your rib cage, squeezing your shoulder blades together. Reach down and hold the bar with a narrow underhand or wider overhand grip. Keep your core tight and back straight, so your body forms a straight line from head to heels. The dumbbells should hang straight down from your shoulders, with your elbows slightly bent (not fully straight) and palms facing each other.
