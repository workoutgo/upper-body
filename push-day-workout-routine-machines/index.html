This is perhaps the most efficient routine out there, as the body is split in terms of type of movement., so the working muscle groups get an overall benefit from the overlap of the various movements, while. Aside from the 2 machine only leg workouts, there is also a push workout day where you’ll train chest, shoulders, and triceps, and a pull workout day where you’ll train back and biceps. A pull workout accompanies it, so you have a push day followed by a pull workout day. For example, with a push/pull/legs split, you’re training all of the upper body “pushing” muscles (chest, shoulders, triceps) and “pulling” muscles (back/biceps/rear delts) in their own individual workouts.
