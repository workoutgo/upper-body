What to eat before a morning workout this could get really specific and be related to the type of workout for weight loss you’re doing, but for the sake of simplicity and hitting the high notes, what it boils down to is that food is fuel for your muscles. Go for a mix of protein and easily digestible carbs, which allows your body to stay energised during your workout without weighing it down. Simply choose your favorite waffle base (such as bananas, protein powder or whole grains). The protein will force your body to use stored carbs and fat, preventing your body from burning muscle during your workout.
