Add one round every two weeks, increase the number of repeats in your hiit workouts from 6 to 10 by week 8. Sports like swimming and other cardiovascular exercises can lower heart rate over time, regulate blood pressure, decrease cholesterol, and help maintain a lower weight, all reducing the risk of a heart attack and stroke. This is a recovery period. It is not as efficient at burning calories as higher intensity exercise like running or cycling, so you will have to go for longer to burn as much fat.
