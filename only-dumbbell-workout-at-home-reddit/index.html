Hey guys, my dumbbells only go to 10kg, so i can&#39;t train hypertrophy range with just them. Add 2 lbs per each successful 3x10 via weighted vest or backpack. For all dumbbell exercises start at the low end of the rep range and increase weight only after all sets are done in the upper top end of the rep range. You really cant do a proper deadlift with a dumbbell, trust me, it just becomes more like another squat.
